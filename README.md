# Air-Quality-Prediction
The main aim of the project is to accurately predict the air quality index or AQI
given the quantity of pollutants suspended in the air.This is done using various techniques
such as regression as well as some time-series analysis with trend and seasonality values.
To make the system more user friendly , It is necessary to create a front end that makes
the application accessible to users who are not well versed in machine learning or
operations of python.
